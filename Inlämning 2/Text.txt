Vi försöker alltid fylla butiken med så mycket i blomsterväg man kan tänka sig. Vi får leveranser från Holland, Danmark och Sverige nästan alla dagar i veckan. Då vi köper in det vi tycker är bäst för tillfället, både när det gäller pris och kvalitet, skiftar sortimentet allt eftersom. Först till kvarn gäller då vi inte tar några beställningar.

Kontakta Oss

Det är alltid lättast att komma i kontakt med oss genom att besöka vår butik men i annat fall kan man kontakta oss på telefon eller e-mail.
Tänk på att vi inte tar beställningar eller förmedlar blommor!
För avvikande öppettider hänvisar vi till Mobilias hemsida.

Information:
GENERAL
1.	Plastic is not fantastic
 - Many think the flowers wrapped in a layer of cellophane look fancier, prettier or more expensive. But the flowers have a hard time breathing inside, it is unneccessary packaging and definitely not so much enviromental friendly.
2.	Remember to bring your own (ideally squere bottom) bag for flower shopping – avoid buying more plastic and make sure to transport your new friends home more safely.  
CUT FLOWERS
3.	A soft rose - soon to dispose  
- Another rule of thumb is to judge the flowers freshness by lightly squeezing its head. The softer the rose is the less time it lasts. This applies to most of the cut flowers. Choose then the ones which still feel hard.
4.	Combine freely
Most of the flowers go well to combine together in a flower arrangement if a few steps are being followed
a) use approximately similar lenght of flowers as you do not want the pretty leaves on the bottom of the long flower to be cut off. 
b) if the stems do not have the same lenght no worries – it is just to remember that they all need to reach into the water in your vase
c) avoid combining daffodils with other flowers as the stem slime after cutting is harmful to other flowers. If you really want them combined with others, place the cut daffodils in a separate vase for a few hours and after getting rid of the stem slime you then may combine them as desired.   
d) in general, try to stick with max 3 different colors for a visually pleasing result.

Tips before purchasing

–	Take advice from your florist
It does not cost anything to get help chosing the right present.
–	Less is more
There are ways to make the arrangement look bigger without neccessery buying too many flowers. Using a grass or any green leaves is usually the way to go. One-hundered red roses in a bouquett surely sounds magical, but I can promis you that even 50 will do the trick. Anyway, who owns a vase that big to actually fit them all?  
–	Stick with seasonal flowers – tulips, pionies, dahlias or other which are not available all year long will definiely be the right choice to say congratulations, thanks or I love you.
–	Even vs. odd number - When many flowers in an arrangement it does not matter. Rule of thumb – even – funeral, odd – birthday. Clear exceptions – when someone turns even birthday, 18 roses etc. This rules does not apply that strictly today anymore.
–	If possible, make sure the person is not allergic to any specific flower / scent / pollen / type of grass.
–	If taking to a hospital, make sure flowers are allowed in the room. Many hospitals do not allow any kind of flowers. Others may allow only odour free ones.  
–	Check quality of roses by pressing their heads slightly to see if they are not too soft. Go for the harder onces which more often lasts longer.
–	Usually it is not advised to mix too many different colours and shapes.
–	Buy cut flowers no earlier than 2 days in advance.
–	If not a pre-made bouquet is chosen, it usually takes about 5-15 minutes (rough estimate) to choose sorts and make a flower arrangement so count with it.

Tips after purchasing
–	Cold outside If it freezes outside make sure your flowers are wrapped properly on your way home. Even 3-5 minutes outside may kill them. The day after they ofter lay down, drop leaves etc.
–	Warm outside
